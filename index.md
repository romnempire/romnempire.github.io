#GO AWAY

Hello, reader.  This is a blag.  As you (if you choose to, and I dearly hope you don't) peruse this blag, you may begin to realise it is extremely - perhaps unreasonably - badly organized, maintained, curated.  This is because it is a shitty blag.

Now, why would an author - to the extent that an author is engaged in the production of text, and occupy a position of liability and responsibility for its contents - choose to write a shitty blag?  Let's start with the question - why blag?  Unfortunately, I've come to a realization that my lived experience is unique and statistically irreplicable.  Now, to Kafka, this might mean writing challenging stories, but I am not Kafka.  I am a programmer, and for me, this uniqueness means I generate and control access to a (possibly useful) dataset of technical knowlege I am well positioned to disseminate.

tl;dr - I might learn things that are useful to share with others, that I want to give some guarantee others have access to.

Now, the crux of the message - why is this blag shitty?  I have, for some time, held off on blogging about things because I was afraid of the consequences of attribution to shitty works.  Let me elaborate.  Multiple individuals, who hold the sceptre of authority in this day and age - that is, EMPLOYMENT, well compensated employment and a shimmer in their eyes that claims, through them, you too may wear the raiment of capital - have informed me blogging (along with publishing to GitHub), are great ways to appeal to employers.  It is insidious.  An art, a science of producing useful utterance has been consigned to the cause of impressing people and making them think you (or your product) is great.  So here's a great fuck you to the people who advise that writing about tech is about showing people you know things so they give you jobs, and the people who blog to gain a reputation for domain specific expertise so they can leverage that to acquire customers.  (Shoutout to [Rebel Labs](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/), I actually really like your reports so don't take this to heart.)  I'm doing this for me.

tl;dr - fuck it, ship it.
